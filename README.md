## Notes

Some challenges encountered while building the app included handling CORS errors and rate limits from the Dog API, which required us to limit fetch requests and ensure that the API key was correctly configured. Additionally, managing React Router to dynamically route each dog breed's unique detail page required careful setup to maintain smooth navigation.
